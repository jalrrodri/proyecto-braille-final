**Spanish Braille Alphabet Dataset**  
This dataset will includes over 10,000 images of the Spanish Braille alphabet, featuring lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. While the images may not be of the highest quality, they are valuable for basic Braille recognition tasks and can serve as a foundation for models designed for accessibility, text-to-Braille conversion, and educational purposes. This dataset is an essential resource for projects focused on improving accessibility for the visually impaired in Spanish-speaking regions.
